    <p>ice balls exist in many different cultures in which rice is eaten, and are particularly prevalent in Asia.

They are also often enjoyed as a snack or side dish with meals</p>
   <h2>ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
    <li>5 ½ cups water, divided</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
    <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>

    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice and 4 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.</li><br><br>
        <li>Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide cooked rice into 8 equal portions. Use one portion of rice for each onigiri.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/YzkNWm_3viegDjtR4YwwzuB-C0E=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/140422-onigiri-japanese-rice-balls-ddmfs-Step-01-2d34fe4ac4794d05927d30fefdbb6e87.jpg" width="40%"></li><br><br>
        <li>Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining portions of rice.<br><img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/fBnCW2kasCYSP889t6nn5RM6ot0=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/140422-onigiri-japanese-rice-balls-ddmfs-Step-03-6e9a66aa42bc45438c6a5f4d8b373c49.jpg" width="40%"> </li>
