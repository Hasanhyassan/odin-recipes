<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Canola oil</li>
    <li>Beef stew meat</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>Beef bouillon granules</li>
    <li>Vegetables</li>
    <li>Seasonings</li>
</ul>

<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><span>Brown the meat</span><br><img src="https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vegetable-Beef-Soup-TOHVS24_41579_MR_09_12_1.jpg?fit=700%2C1024" width="40%"><br><p>In a large stockpot, heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil over medium heat. Brown the beef in batches to seal their juices, adding more oil if necessary. Remove the chunks with a slotted spoon and set them aside on a plate or bowl.
Editor’s Tip: Browning the meat is a classic soup and stew tip. Searing it over high heat adds a richer flavor thanks to the chemical reaction that browns and caramelizes the meat. It’s best to do it in batches to prevent the meat from simmering in its juices and halting the caramelization you’re after.</p></li><br><br>
    <li><Span>Incorporate the onions </Span> <img src="" width="20%"><p>Add the onions to the drippings and stir until tender. Discard the drippings and return the beef to the pot.
Editor’s Tip: Cooking the onions in the drippings does a few things. First, as the onions break down, their juices will help pull up the lovely brown bits, aka the fond, that the seared beef left behind. That’s all flavor. Second, onions are known aromatics that add flavor and aroma to dishes.</p></li>
    <li><span>  Make the broth </span>   <br><img src="https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vegetable-Beef-Soup-TOHVS24_41579_MR_09_12_2.jpg?fit=700%2C1024" width="40%"><p>Stir in the water, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce and beef bouillon granules. Bring everything to a boil.
Reduce the heat, cover the mixture with a lid and simmer for 45 minutes.
Editor’s Tip: You can easily substitute bouillon and water for an equal amount of beef stock or broth</p></li>
    <li> <span>  Add the veggies</span>  <br><img src="https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vegetable-Beef-Soup-TOHVS24_41579_MR_09_12_3.jpg?fit=700%2C1024" width="40%"><p>Stir in the red potatoes, cabbage, carrots, celery, corn, peas, green beans and lima beans. Then add dried herbs, salt and pepper. Return the soup to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 35 minutes.</p><br><img src="https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vegetable-Beef-Soup-TOHVS24_41579_MR_09_12_4.jpg?fit=700%2C1024" width="40%"><p>Editor’s Tip: The difference between boiling and simmering is due to temperature and the amount of movement in the liquid. Lower heat and slower bubbles mean the ingredients have time to get tender and the flavors to develop.</p></li>
    <li> <span> Finish the soup </span> <br><img src="https://www.tasteofhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vegetable-Beef-Soup-TOHVP24_41579_MR_09_12_1.jpg?fit=700%2C1024" width="40%"><p>tir in the okra and cook the soup 15 to 20 minutes longer or until the chunks of beef and the vegetables are tender. Discard the bay leaf before serving.</p></li>
